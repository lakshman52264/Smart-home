# Project Title: Smart Home Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains data and a Jupyter notebook for analyzing smart home data. The project aims to provide insights into various aspects of smart home automation, energy consumption, and user behavior.

## Contents

- `dataset.csv`: The dataset containing smart home data.
- `smart home.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the analysis and visualizations of the smart home data.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following packages:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-home-data-analysis.git
   cd smart-home-data-analysis
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required packages installed.

3. Open the Jupyter notebook.

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook smart home.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis and visualize the data.

## Dataset

The `dataset.csv` file contains the following columns:

- `Timestamp`: Date and time of the data entry.
- `Temperature`: The temperature reading in Celsius.
- `Humidity`: The humidity level percentage.
- `Energy Consumption`: The amount of energy consumed in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
- `Device Status`: The status of various smart home devices (e.g., ON/OFF).
- `Occupancy`: The number of occupants in the home.

## Analysis

The Jupyter notebook includes the following analyses:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, data types conversion, and basic statistics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing temperature, humidity, energy consumption, and device status over time.
3. **Energy Consumption Patterns**: Identifying patterns and trends in energy usage.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationships between temperature, humidity, and energy consumption.
5. **Occupancy Patterns**: Analyzing how occupancy affects energy consumption and device usage.
